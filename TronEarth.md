# Introduction #

Any middle-age computer nerd still believes there's a tiny Tron World inside their computer... here's how to explore it using Google Earth :)

# KML/KMZ #

[Tron Earth.kmz](http://wonderama.googlecode.com/files/Tron%20Earth.kmz)

Darkened Earth and TRON logo (can be turned off). The image later is a deep dark blue, which I think works better than completely black.

# Google Earth Layers #

Turn off everything, and try with these on...

  * Borders -> Borders (don't need Labels)
  * Roads
  * More -> Transportation
  * More -> Traffic

Also try "View -> Sun" and slide the time to early morning or late afternoon.

If you still have enough rendering grunt try "Weather -> Clouds"


# Additional things you can do.. #

A proxy server which is redirecting some of the Google Earth icons to an empty/transparent image.

# Invisible TTF font #

Remove those pesky road names. Search for invisible.ttf and install. Choose it as your default 3D Font in Tools -> Options.

# Sound Track? #

I suggest Daft Punk's "Zero Unit Demolus Remix".
